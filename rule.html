      <ol>
        <li>
          Turn On the Game: Press any button to turn on the game unit. The
          game starts with a brief sequence to indicate level1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the Game: The game will begin with a single button lighting up
          and emitting a sound. This is the first step of the pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the Pattern: After the first button's sequence, you must press
          the same button. For example, if the red button lights up, you press
          the red button. The game will then play the first button's sequence
          again and add a new button to the pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the Growing Pattern: The game will continue to add new buttons
          to the sequence, and you must remember and repeat the pattern from the
          very beginning each time. For instance, if the sequence is red, blue,
          green, and it adds yellow, you need to press red, blue, green, and
          then yellow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep Going: As you progress, the pattern becomes longer and more
          challenging to remember. The game continues to test your memory and
          ability to replicate the growing sequence of lights and sounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mistakes: If you press the wrong button or press a button out of
          sequence, the game will signal an incorrect response with a buzzing
          sound, and the game sequence will start again from the beginning.
